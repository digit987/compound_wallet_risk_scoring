# compound_wallet_risk_scoring
A rule-based risk scoring system for Ethereum wallets interacting with the Compound protocol. It retrieves wallet transaction data using the Covalent API, extracts behavioral and financial features (such as borrow/repay ratios, activity span, liquidation indicators), and assigns a normalized risk score between 0â€“1000.
